### Overview of types of Annotations 

#### Alpha Satellite 
- "active_hor(SFx)" - active HOR array, identified as longest HOR array on chromosome as of version 0.1
- "hor(SFx)" or "mon/hor(SFx)" - HOR repeats, summarized from superfamily annotations SF1-6
- "dhor(SF0x)" - divered HOR repeats of superfamilies 01 and 02
- "mon" - other superfamilies SF7+ 
- "mixedAlpha(SFx, SFy) - regions that can't clearly be resolved as one SF 

#### Other Satellite Annotations
- "hsat1A" - RepeatMasker SAR annotation 
- "hsat1B - RepeatMasker HSATI annotation 
- "gsat(gsattype)" - RepeatMasker GSat Annotations 
- "HSat2" - Annotated with Nick Altemose' perl script [here](https://github.com/altemose/chm13_hsat)
- "HSat3" - Annotated with Nick Altemose' perl script [here](https://github.com/altemose/chm13_hsat) and Tandem Repeat Finder
- "HSat2_3" - Classical human satellites that can't be resolved HSat2 or HSat3 with current annotations methods. 

#### Composite Satellite Annotations 
- "bSat(monomerTypes)" - RepeatMasker annotations, monomers include BSR, BSAT, LSAU
- "cenSat(monomerTypes)" - RepeatMasker annotations - other satellites enriched in centromere, includes CER, SATR, SST1, ACRO, HSAT4/5, and TAF11
- "subTerm(monomerTypes)" - Sub terminal satellite repeats - non human primate specific. Monomers are species specific but include PtpCHT7 and StSat_pCHT_v6_Pp


#### Other Annotations 
- "ct" - Centromere transition region, see schema below for definition
- "GAP" - regions of N's annotated using Seqtk gap 
- "rDNA" - rDNA annotated with annotation workflow [here](https://github.com/kmiga/alphaAnnotation/blob/main/cenSatAnnotation/tasks/rDNA_annotation.wdl)

## Censat v0.1 Release 5/6/24

First draft primate censat annotations for *Pan troglodytes*, *Pan paniscus*, and *Gorilla gorilla*
Please document any issues you find in [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UVqb11FiSKcm3jpo81KQGn1jd74TxLODyUpQr-bNBhk/edit?usp=sharing) 

Note - Versions 0.1 may have some overlaps in some of the smaller satellite annotations, alpha satellite annotations should have all overlaps resolved. 

## Censat v0.1 Release 5/22/24

First draft primate censat annotations for *Pongo abellie* and *Pongo pygmaeus*

These files are rough drafts - the annotations are incomplete especially in classical human satellites and acrocentric short arms. 

## Censat v1.0 Release 6/20/24

Centromeric satellite annotations version 1 for all T2T primates. HSat annotations have been improved using pentameric simple repeat annotations from Tandem Repeat Finder run via RepeatMasker.  
The following species specific manual changes have been made:  
- *Pan paniscus* the active arrays on the following contigs have been manually annotated based on visual inspection of CenpA localization and CDR: chr14_mat_hsa13, chr17_pat_hsa18, chr13_mat_hsa2b, chr13_pat_hsa2b, chr2_mat_hsa3, chr6_pat_hsa7, chr6_mat_hsa7
- *Symphalangus syndactylus* Subterminal alpha satellite arrays were manually identified and marked as subTerm(SF4)

## Censat v1.2 7/1/24

Updated the color palette to match what will go into the final publications. Fixed erroneous "ct" annotations between scaffolding N's and rDNA and classical satellite annotations. 

Active alpha satellite arrays were curated to reflect CENPA location and CDR in the following contigs:
- *Pan paniscus* chr14_mat_hsa13, chr17_pat_hsa18, chr13_mat_hsa2b, chr13_pat_hsa2b, chr13_pat_hsa2b, chr2_mat_hsa3, chr2_mat_hsa3, chr6_mat_hsa7, and chr23_pat_hsa22
- *Pongo abellie* chr6_hap2_hsa7 and chr9_hap1_hsa11
- *Pongo pygmaeus* chr12_hap1_hsa2a and chr12_hap2_hsa2a
- *Symphalangus syndactylus* Subterminal alpha satellite arrays were manually identified and marked as subTerm(SF4)


# CenSat v2.0 8/29/24 

Alterations to the handling of annotations within the "CenSat" bin to more completely cover complex and composite regions. Arrays now cover gaps caused by mobile element insertions smaller than 10kb. 

Composite satellite element names truncated for shorter naming convention. For example COMP-subunit_TSPY_rnd-1_family-25 is truncated to TSPY_family-25

Finalized manual active array annotations for the following 

- *Pan paniscus* chr14_mat_hsa13, chr17_pat_hsa18, chr13_mat_hsa2b, chr13_pat_hsa2b, chr2_mat_hsa3, chr2_mat_hsa3, chr6_mat_hsa7, chr6_pat_hsa7, chr23_pat_hsa22
chr23_mat_hsa22
- *Pongo abellie* chr6_hap2_hsa7, chr9_hap1_hsa11, chr8_hap2_hsa10
- *Pongo pygmaeus*  chr12_hap1_hsa2a and chr12_hap2_hsa2a
- *Symphalangus syndactylus* chrY_hap2 

### Note - *Symphalangus syndactylus*  updated 9/3/24
